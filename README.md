ðŸ“¡ Hybrid Communication System â€“ Multi-Mode Transmission & Synchronization

This project demonstrates a hybrid communication system that integrates analog and digital transmission techniques to maximize channel efficiency and reliability. Developed for Communication Theory Lab (EEE3208), it dynamically combines AM, FM, SSB, TDM, and FDM within a unified system.

ðŸŒŸ Highlights

Multi-Signal Integration: Handles speech, music, and digital signals in a single channel.

Dual Multiplexing: TDM for digital, FDM for analog â€“ optimized bandwidth usage.

Modulation Techniques: AM for voice, FM for music (noise-resilient), SSB for bandwidth efficiency.

High Synchronization: Achieves ~99.7% synchronization for accurate signal reconstruction.

MATLAB Simulation: Includes realistic channel models with noise and synchronization errors.
