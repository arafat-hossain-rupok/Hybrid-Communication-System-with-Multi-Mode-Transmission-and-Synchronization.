Overview of HybridCommApp.mThe provided file, HybridCommApp.m, is a MATLAB App Designer file that defines a graphical user interface (GUI) application for a hybrid communication system. The application allows users to record speech and music signals, modulate them using different modulation techniques (AM, FM, and SSB), add noise and delay to the modulated signal, demodulate the received signal, and play the demodulated audio.GUI ComponentsThe GUI consists of the following components:Record Speech and Record Music buttons: allow users to record 5-second speech and music signalsModulation Type button group: allows users to select the modulation technique (AM, FM, or SSB)Modulate button: modulates the recorded signals using the selected modulation techniqueAdd Noise & Delay button: adds noise and delay to the modulated signalDemodulate button: demodulates the received signalPlay Audio button: plays the demodulated audioNoise Slider and Delay Slider: allow users to adjust the noise level and delay amountSignal Plot: displays the modulated, received, and demodulated signalsMSE Label: displays the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and demodulated signalsMethods and FunctionsThe file defines several private methods and functions that handle the GUI events and perform the necessary signal processing tasks:recordSpeech and recordMusic: record speech and music signalsmodulateSignal: modulates the recorded signals using the selected modulation techniqueaddNoiseAndDelay: adds noise and delay to the modulated signaldemodulateSignal: demodulates the received signalplayAudio: plays the demodulated audiostartupFcn: initializes the GUI components and sets up the event handlersModulation TechniquesThe application supports three modulation techniques:AM (Amplitude Modulation): modulates the amplitude of the carrier signal based on the speech signalFM (Frequency Modulation): modulates the frequency of the carrier signal based on the music signalSSB (Single-Sideband Modulation): modulates the carrier signal using the Hilbert transform and exponential functionOverall, the HybridCommApp.m file provides a comprehensive GUI application for demonstrating and exploring different modulation techniques and signal processing concepts in a hybrid communication system.
